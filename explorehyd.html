            <p>
              Hyderabad, also known as the city of pearls has rich history of its own. Here, the past and present seamlessly blend together.

              Once ruled by the Royal Nizams this city is a living example of their love for arts and culture and every nook and corner bears witness of their rich heritage and is the legacy they left behind.
              
              Old city was once the hub of cosmopolitan culture, with migrants from across India, this is evident from the architectural influences that are visible in old city, Rajasthani, Maharashtrian, and other architectural styles which bear testimony to Hyderabad’s century-old cosmopolitan culture.
              
              Hyderabad’s tourist season is lean to moderate throughout the year, so anytime (save March, April, and May when temperatures skyrocket in the landlocked arid regions) is a good time.
              
              The month of Ramzan is a special time to visit as the old city truly comes alive during this month. From late night bazaars to streets dotted with little carts and stalls selling the most delectable delicacies specially prepared for this month.
              
              According to the Mercer Quality of Living Rating 2018, Hyderabad was named as the best city to live in - for the fourth time in a row! A must visit for anyone looking for an all-encompassing experience filled with history, culture and so much more.
